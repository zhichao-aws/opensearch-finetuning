{"id": "doc_aws", "text": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. It offers over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally, including computing power, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and enterprise applications."}
{"id": "doc_ml", "text": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computer systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves through pattern recognition and computational statistics."}
{"id": "doc_python", "text": "Python has become one of the most popular programming languages for data science and artificial intelligence. Its simple syntax, extensive libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, and strong community support make it an ideal choice for machine learning projects and data analysis."}
{"id": "doc_opensearch", "text": "OpenSearch is an open-source search and analytics engine derived from Elasticsearch. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. OpenSearch is commonly used for log analytics, real-time application monitoring, and clickstream analysis."}
{"id": "doc_finetune", "text": "Fine-tuning is a transfer learning technique where a pre-trained model is further trained on a specific task or dataset. This approach allows models to leverage knowledge learned from large datasets and adapt it to specialized domains, often achieving better performance with less training data than training from scratch."}
{"id": "doc_nlp", "text": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language. Modern NLP techniques use deep learning models like transformers to perform tasks such as translation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and text generation."}
{"id": "doc_embeddings", "text": "Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data that capture semantic meaning in a high-dimensional space. In NLP, words or sentences with similar meanings have similar vector representations, allowing machine learning models to understand relationships and context in text data."}
{"id": "doc_sagemaker", "text": "SageMaker is Amazon's fully managed machine learning service that enables developers and data scientists to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale. It provides a complete set of tools for the entire machine learning workflow, from data labeling to model monitoring in production."}
{"id": "doc_rag", "text": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. It first retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base, then uses these documents as context for generating accurate and informed responses, reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy."}
{"id": "doc_transformers", "text": "Transformer models revolutionized natural language processing with their attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when making predictions. BERT, GPT, and other transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art results across numerous NLP tasks."}
